# Face-Dataset-Generator
Reads a video file, detects faces from each frame, saves the frames in some* folder and saves the cropped faces in another* folder.

1. Replace 'file_name.mp4' in line 6 with your video file name.
2. To change path, name format
      * Modify line 27 (for frames)
      * Modify line 39 (for cropped faces)
3. Line number 13, 20, 36 (Uncomment these lines to realize the faces get detected frame by frame, will slow down the saving process)
